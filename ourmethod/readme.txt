Here, we will release some original codes.

Since we have many experimental steps, we share the main function code here.

perplexity.py is used for getting a  'perplexity'.

lda.py is used for getting the distribution of topics under each document and the distribution of words under each topic.

There are some main functions in featuresel.py, such as 'Boxing method'ï¼Œ'CFR method' etc..
